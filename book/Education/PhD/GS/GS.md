# Graduate School

As a PhD candidate at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) the Doctoral Education (DE) programme is an integral part of my PhD trajectory. This programme facilitates me in developing the competences (knowledge, skills, attitudes, insights) and mindset I need to successfully complete your PhD trajectory and become an independent researcher. A general overview of the PhD trajectory can be found in the {ref}`PhD_Development_Cycle_UGS`.

## DE requirements
In order to obtain a doctoral degree from the TU Delft I have to complete the DE programme. This programme consists of freely chosen courses and learning on the job activities in 3 competence categories (discipline related skills, research skills and transferable skills) of the Doctoral Education Competence Model. For each category, I must obtain a minimum of 15 GS credits, making a total of 45 GS credits.

The {ref}`Competence_model` serves as the foundation of the Doctoral Education programme. This model outlines all the vital competences you need to successfully navigate your PhD and thrive as an autonomous researcher. An overview on how to obtain each of the skills is given in {ref}`Table_skills`.
