# Transferable skills
As a PhD candidate, it's easy to focus solely on developing deep expertise in your research field. However, succeeding in academia—or transitioning to roles beyond it—requires more than technical knowledge. That’s where transferable (soft) skills come in. These are essential, cross-disciplinary abilities like communication, collaboration, leadership, time management, and critical thinking. They help you navigate complex work environments, contribute effectively to teams, manage your own progress, and engage meaningfully with stakeholders inside and outside academia. To strengthen these competencies, I’ve participated in several courses as part of the PhD development program.

## Social Safety Dialogue
The Social Safety Dialogue organized for PhD students in the Engineering Structures department provided a valuable opportunity to openly discuss issues related to safety, respect, and well-being in the academic environment. As a PhD candidate, you often find yourself in a vulnerable and dependent position—relying on supervisors for guidance, resources, and career progression—making it difficult to speak up when boundaries are crossed or expectations become unclear or overwhelming.

This afternoon created space to share experiences, raise concerns, and reflect on what a safe and supportive work environment should look like. It also helped raise awareness among peers and staff about the challenges PhDs may face, and the importance of mutual respect, transparency, and clear communication. Engaging in such dialogues is a step toward a healthier academic culture where everyone feels heard and empowered to contribute to a constructive and inclusive research environment.

## PhD Start-up

### T4.G1 - AI | PhD Startup Module A-I: Introduction to the Graduate School (on campus)
During the first interactive session (Module A-I), I shared my experiences, expectations, and initial questions regarding the start of my PhD trajectory. Together with other participants, I reflected on the challenges I’ve encountered so far and took a closer look at my current skillset and areas for development. We also discussed the roles and responsibilities within the supervisory team, which helped clarify expectations on both sides. A highlight of the session was the Q&A with senior peers, where I had the opportunity to ask candid and sometimes provocative questions in a confidential setting. Overall, it was a valuable and insightful start to the professional development programme.
