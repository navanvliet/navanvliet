# Research skills

As part of the PhD Development Programme, I’ve started building up credits in the Research Skills category. This category is essential for developing the core competencies needed to carry out high-quality, independent research. It includes skills like designing experiments or simulations, working with data, writing scientific papers, and critically evaluating literature.

What makes this category unique is that it allows for credit accumulation not only through formal courses, but also through Learning on the Job (LotJ) activities. These activities are integrated into daily research work—such as writing a paper, presenting at a conference, reviewing literature, or co-supervising students—and help bridge the gap between learning and practice. I’ve already completed some LotJ activities, which gave me the opportunity to gain practical experience while contributing meaningfully to my project.

This flexible approach has been valuable, as it aligns well with my day-to-day research and helps track the professional development that naturally occurs throughout the PhD.

## R2.B1 | Speedreading and Mindmapping (on-campus)
In this course, I developed practical techniques to read scientific literature more efficiently and process complex information more effectively. I learned how to increase my reading speed through structured speedreading exercises, which helped me quickly filter relevant information from large volumes of text. Additionally, I was introduced to mindmapping as a tool to organize, consolidate, and communicate ideas. Creating mindmaps helped me build clearer mental frameworks and compare insights across multiple sources. These skills are already proving valuable in my day-to-day research work, especially when reviewing literature, preparing proposals, and structuring new ideas.
