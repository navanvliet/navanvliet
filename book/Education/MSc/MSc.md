### A-module: Structural Mechanics and Dynamics (CIEM5110)
This module offers advanced knowledge in civil engineering mechanics and dynamics, balancing theory with practical applications. You will learn to analyse structural stability under static and dynamic loads, use computational techniques, and handle vibration measurements. The module covers finite element analysis, vibration analysis, and designing measurement setups.

### B-module: Applied Mechanics of Structures (CIEM5210)
This module provides students with in-depth expertise on the analysis of the mechanical response of structures. Analytical and computational techniques are explained and applied. The module offers students the possibility to become applied mechanics specialists with the ability to use state-of-the-art computational tools and analytical tools across the structural engineering field. The module also prepares students to contribute to academic research that advances the limits of computational and analytical tools for analysis of the mechanical response of structures.
