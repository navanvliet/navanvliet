# Albert Heijn

When I was young, I got my first job at {ref}`AH_Bloemendaal`, part of Ahold Delhaize. I started as a shelf stocker (vakkenvuller in Dutch), mostly filling up dairy and ready-to-eat meals. It taught me how to work quickly, pay attention to details, and handle products carefullyâ€”especially stuff that goes bad fast.

After a while, I learned about different fruits and veggies and got moved to the fruit and vegetable section (AGF-afdeling in Dutch). There, I got to know how to pick and handle fresh produce, and I helped customers with questions too. This really improved my communication skills and showed me how to work well with the team during busy times.

That first job was a great experience that helped me develop a good work ethic, responsibility, and the ability to adapt to new tasks. Apart from that it also gave me a behind-the-scenes at a grocery story.
