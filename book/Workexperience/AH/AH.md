When I was young, I got my first job at {ref}`AH_Bloemendaal`, part of Ahold Delhaize. I started as a shelf stocker (vakkenvuller in Dutch), mostly filling up dairy and ready-to-eat meals. It taught me how to work quickly, pay attention to details, and handle products carefully.

After a while, I learned about different fruits and veggies and got moved to the fruit and vegetable section (AGF-afdeling in Dutch). There, I got to know how to pick and handle fresh produce, and I helped customers with questions too. This really improved my communication skills and showed me how to work well with the team during busy times. Apart from that it also gave me a behind-the-scenes at a grocery story.
