During the summer following the onset of COVID-19, I took up a remote position with [TTC Health Services](https://www.ttchs.com/) in July, after being referred by a friend. Following a two-day training session in Amsterdam, I began working in the call center for Schiphol Airport. Callers frequently asked about travel certificates or vaccination requirementsâ€”topics that fell under the responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or individual airlines, not the airport itself. My role primarily involved directing callers to the correct authorities and accurately reporting inquiries. After noticing areas for improvement during the first weekend, I proactively shared constructive feedback via email. This initiative led to my promotion to co-team leader, as the originally appointed person proved unsuitable for the role.

The job was both flexible and productive, allowing me to study or read during quiet periods. After a few months, our responsibilities expanded to include handling inquiries related to airport parking. Eventually, the team was dismantled as COVID-19 regulations eased and demand declined. Overall, it was a valuable temporary experience that sharpened several professional competencies.
